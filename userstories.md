## 0.1 Download Application on Android

As a parent, I tend to lose my keys and other smaller objects a lot. I would like to find an application that could locate and receive visual feedback about these objects.

### Elaboration

Users should have the ability to use a small bluetooth device in tandem with an Android device to find small objects, by displaying a visual representation of the object in a 3D environment. 

### Constraints

Must be able to download/install onto an Android device.

### Effort Estimation

Less than an hour

### Acceptance Test

Download the APK from an external source onto an Android device, install the application and run the application on the phone.
